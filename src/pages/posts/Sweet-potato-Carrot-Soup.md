# Sweet Potato and Carrot Soup with Curry

## Ingredients:
- Sweet potatoes
- Carrots
- Onion
- Garlic
- Vegetable broth
- Curry powder
- Turmeric
- Parsley
- Chives
- Salt
- Pepper
- Olive oil

## Instructions:

1. Peel and chop the sweet potatoes, carrots, onion, and garlic.

2. In a large pot, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and saut√© until softened and fragrant. Stir in curry powder and turmeric to coat the onions and garlic, removing any dusty flavor.

3. Add the chopped sweet potatoes and carrots to the pot, and stir to combine with the onion, garlic, and spices.

4. Pour in enough vegetable broth to cover the vegetables. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let the soup simmer until the vegetables are tender.

5. Once the vegetables are cooked through, use an immersion blender to puree the soup until smooth. Alternatively, you can transfer the soup in batches to a blender and blend until smooth, then return it to the pot.

6. Stir in additional curry powder and turmeric to taste, adjusting the amount according to your preference for spiciness and color.

7. Finely chop parsley and chives, then add them to the soup for added flavor.

8. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.

9. Let the soup simmer for a few more minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

10. Serve the sweet potato and carrot soup hot. Enjoy this comforting and flavorful soup!
