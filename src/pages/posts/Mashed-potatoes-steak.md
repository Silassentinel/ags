# White Cabbage Mash with Steak

## Ingredients:
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 4 to 5 potatoes, peeled and diced
- Water
- 1/2 white cabbage, finely chopped
- 1 bouillon cube
- Pepper, nutmeg, turmeric, and curry powder, to taste
- 2 tablespoons Dijon Mustard
- Steak
- Salt

## Instructions:
1. In a pot, brown the finely chopped onion until caramelized.

2. Add the minced garlic to the pot.

3. Add the peeled and diced potatoes to the pot. Add enough water to cover the potatoes halfway.

4. Once half of the water has evaporated, add the finely chopped white cabbage to the pot.

5. When all the water has evaporated, add the bouillon cube, along with desired amounts of pepper, nutmeg, turmeric, and curry powder. Saut√© the mixture.

6. Add water to nearly cover the mixture and turn the heat to high.

7. Cover the pot with a lid and let it come to a boil.

8. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. When the potatoes begin to fall apart, remove the lid to allow most of the remaining liquid to evaporate.

9. Stir in 2 generous tablespoons of Dijon Mustard.

10. Finally, either blend or mash the mixture to your preferred consistency. If there's a little liquid left, keep it on low heat to allow the remaining moisture to evaporate.

11. Meanwhile, pre-season the steak with pepper.

12. Heat a grill pan until it's very hot. Salt the steak and grill for 1 to 2 minutes per side.

Enjoy your flavorful White Cabbage Mash with perfectly grilled steak! üòÅ
