# Smoked Bacon Burgers

## Ingredients:
- Bacon
- Burgers (quantity needed)
- Dry rub
- Pesto (homemade)
- Potatoes
- Applewood chips
- Ribs
- Salt

## Instructions:
1. Marinate the bacon with dry rub for at least 24 hours and let it rest in the refrigerator.
2. Weave the marinated bacon around each burger, securing it with toothpicks if needed.
3. Smoke the bacon-wrapped burgers indirectly using applewood chips for a smoky flavor. Avoid placing them directly over high heat.
4. Prepare homemade pesto to be served with the burgers. Coat the potatoes with pesto and wrap them in aluminum foil.
5. While the burgers are smoking, cook the pesto-covered potatoes in aluminum foil on the BBQ.
6. Simultaneously, pre-smoke the ribs for tomorrow's cooking. Apply a thin layer of dry rub to the ribs.
7. Tomorrow, cook the pre-smoked ribs until they're tender and flavorful.
8. Serve the smoked bacon burgers with pesto-covered potatoes and the deliciously cooked ribs.

Enjoy your incredible meal of Smoked Bacon Burgers, Pesto Potatoes, and succulent Ribs!
