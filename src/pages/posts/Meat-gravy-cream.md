# Meat Gravy with Cream

## Ingredients:
- Meatballs
- Cream
- Water
- Butter
- Pepper and salt
- Brown sauce powder

## Instructions:

1. Create meatballs from the remaining ground meat.

2. Heat a skillet or saucepan over high heat and add a bit of butter. 

3. Fry the meatballs in the pan, adding a small amount of water occasionally to keep them moist and prevent sticking.

4. Once the meatballs are nearly cooked, remove them from the pan.

5. Add 100 ml of water to the pan and then gradually incorporate 50 grams of brown sauce powder and 200 ml of cream. 

6. Stir continuously until the sauce thickens to your desired consistency.

7. Season the gravy with pepper, salt, fresh parsley, and bieslook (chives).

8. Return the meatballs to the pan to enhance the flavor of the gravy.

9. Serve the meat gravy with cream over your favorite dishes, such as meatballs, mashed potatoes, or other dishes of your choice. Enjoy!
