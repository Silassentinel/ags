## Instructions:

### Preparing the Ribs and Sauce:

1. Sear the Ribs:

Heat a cast iron pan over medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil.

Sear the ribs on all sides until browned. Remove and let rest.



2. Cook the Onions and Garlic:

In the same pan, add the onion rings and garlic cloves (leave in their peels).

Sauté until fragrant and slightly caramelized.



3. Sauté the Vegetables:

Cook the turnips and parsnips one type at a time in the pan.

Remove each batch after sautéing and season with thyme, salt, and pepper.



4. Build the Sauce:

Return all sautéed vegetables to the pan.

Add the crushed tomatoes and scrape the bottom to deglaze the pan.

Let the sauce simmer until it thickens.



5. Add the Ribs and Rosemary:

Place the ribs on top of the sauce.

Nestle rosemary sprigs just below the ribs.

Cover and let simmer on low heat until the ribs are tender (about 1.5–2 hours).

### Preparing the Garlic Butter Mash:

Mash together with butter, egg, and a splash of milk until creamy.

Season with salt to taste.
