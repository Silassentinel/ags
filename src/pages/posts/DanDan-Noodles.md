# Breaded Dandan Meatballs with Udon Noodles, Chinese Cabbage, and Sweet Paprika

## Breaded Dandan Meatballs

### Ingredients:
* Ground meat (beef or pork)
* Tahini sauce
* Miso paste
* Soy sauce
* Ginger
* Onion
* Garlic
* Salt
* Pepper
* Panko breadcrumbs

### Instructions:
1. Grate the ginger and garlic. Finely chop the onion.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the ground meat, tahini sauce, miso paste, soy sauce, grated ginger, chopped onion, chopped garlic, salt, and pepper. Mix well.
3. If the mixture is too wet, add some panko breadcrumbs to bind it together.
4. Wet your hands slightly to prevent sticking, then roll the meat mixture into bite-sized balls, about 2-4 cm in diameter.

## Breading the Balls

### Ingredients:
* Flour
* Egg yolks
* Panko breadcrumbs

### Instructions:
1. Season the flour and panko breadcrumbs to your liking (optional).
2. Set up a breading station with three bowls: one with flour, one with beaten egg yolks, and one with panko breadcrumbs.
3. Roll each meatball in flour, then dip it in the egg yolks, and finally coat it evenly with panko breadcrumbs.
4. Heat neutral oil in a deep pan over medium heat.
5. Fry the breaded meatballs until they are evenly cooked and golden brown, turning regularly for even cooking.

## Udon Noodles

### Ingredients:
* Udon noodles
* Eggs (one each)
* Salt

### Instructions:
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
2. Pierce each egg gently with a needle to make peeling easier later.
3. Once the water is boiling, carefully lower the eggs into the pot with a spoon to avoid breaking them.
4. Add the udon noodles to the boiling water.
5. Boil the noodles for 5-6 minutes, or until they are cooked through but still slightly firm to the bite.
6. Boil the eggs for the same amount of time for a runny yolk.

## Veggies

### Ingredients:
* Chinese cabbage
* Sweet paprika
* Red onion
* Garlic
* Soy sauce
* Oyster sauce (optional)
* Noodle cooking water

### Instructions:
1. Cut the bottom 4 cm from the cabbage (hard white part), then cut the cabbage lengthwise into strips, similar in size to the noodles.
2. Clean the paprika, remove the seeds, and slice it into rings.
3. Finely dice the red onion and garlic.
4. In a pan, sauté the diced onion and garlic until fragrant.
5. Add the cabbage and paprika to the pan.
6. Stir in some splashes of soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) for added umami flavor.
7. Add a ladle of the noodle cooking water to the pan to create a sauce.

## Presentation
1. Serve the meatballs on a bed of udon noodles, topped with the sautéed veggies.
2. Place a boiled egg on top of each serving.
3. Garnish with chopped peanuts according to taste.
