# Jalapeño Poppers

## Ingredients:
- Jalapeño Peppers (or similar-sized peppers)
- Shredded cheese mix (Emmentaler, Appenzeller, Comte, Gruyère, or your choice)
- Bacon strips
- Good butter
- Beer
- BBQ rub

## Instructions:

1. Start by cleaning the bacon strips, removing any skin and pieces of bone. Season the bacon strips with your favorite BBQ rub.

2. Cut the tops off the peppers to create an opening for stuffing.

3. Wrap each pepper with a seasoned bacon strip.

4. Stuff the shredded cheese mix into the peppers. Be generous with the cheese filling.

5. In a pan, melt a few dollops of good butter.

6. Add a glug of beer to the melted butter.

7. Arrange the stuffed peppers in the pan with the beer and butter mixture.

8. You have two cooking options:
   - **Option 1**: Smoke the stuffed peppers on the BBQ until the bacon is crispy, and the peppers are tender.
   - **Option 2**: Broil the stuffed peppers in the oven until the bacon is cooked to your desired level of crispiness.

9. Once the bacon is done, your jalapeño poppers are ready to be enjoyed.
