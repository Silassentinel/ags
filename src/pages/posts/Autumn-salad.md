# Autumn Salad

## Ingredients:
- Beetroots
- Mushrooms
- Crispy bacon strips
- Green beans (princess beans)
- Curly lettuce
- Roasted nuts (of your choice)
- Fresh parsley
- Garlic cloves
- Pepper and salt
- Nutmeg

## Instructions:

1. Begin by cooking the beetroots along with the green beans and a splash of red wine vinegar.

2. Remove the green beans when they are almost tender, as they will continue to cook with the residual heat.

3. While the beans and beetroots are cooking, sauté the mushrooms in a separate pan. Season them generously with fresh parsley and garlic. Add a small amount of cooking fat and a dash of water at the beginning to prevent sticking. Continue cooking until they are nicely browned and tender.

4. Once the mushrooms are cooked to your satisfaction, remove them from the pan.

5. In the same pan, add the bacon strips. Cook them until they become crispy and delicious.

6. Assemble your autumn salad by starting with a bed of curly lettuce.

7. Slice the cooked beetroots and add them to the salad.

8. Arrange the sautéed mushrooms on top of the beetroots.

9. Sprinkle the crispy bacon strips over the mushrooms.

10. Place the blanched green beans on the salad.

11. Finish by adding roasted nuts of your choice for extra crunch and flavor.

12. Season the salad with freshly ground pepper, salt, and a pinch of nutmeg.

13. Serve and enjoy your hearty and flavorful Autumn Salad!

This salad is a wonderful combination of the earthy flavors of beetroots and mushrooms, the salty crunch of bacon, and the freshness of green beans and curly lettuce.
