# Hearty Vegetable and Fish Soup

## Ingredients:
- Onions
- Garlic
- Chili pepper
- Carrots
- Parsnips
- Butternut squash
- Whitefish fillets (e.g., Peterman)
- Cloves
- Bay leaf
- Salt
- A pinch of cinnamon
- A generous knob of farm butter

## Instructions:

1. Dice onions, garlic, and a chili pepper, then saut√© them with a generous knob of farm butter until softened.

2. Meanwhile, finely dice the vegetables in Brunoise style, starting with carrots, followed by parsnips, and finally the butternut squash. This ensures even cooking without overcooking.

3. As the vegetables cook, add cloves, a bay leaf, salt, and a pinch of cinnamon to season the soup.

4. While the vegetables are cooking, cut the fish fillets into 4x4 cm cubes.

5. Once the vegetables are tender and flavorful with the added spices, turn off the heat and add the fish cubes. Let it continue cooking until the fish is done.

6. Adjust the seasoning if necessary.

7. Serve this delightful and aromatic vegetable and fish soup hot, and savor the rich flavors!
