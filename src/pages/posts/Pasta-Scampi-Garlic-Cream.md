* Fennel fronds
* Large scampi
* Shallot
* Garlic
* Butter
* Heavy cream
* Pepper

# Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Scampi:**
   * Melt butter in a large pan over medium heat.
   * Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant.
   * Add the scampi to the pan and cook until they are just starting to color, but not fully cooked.
   * Remove the scampi from the pan and set aside.

   * If desired, add a splash of white wine and let it cook off.
   * Cut the fennel bulb into bite-sized pieces and add to the pan.
   * Sauté until the fennel is tender. Reserve some fennel fronds for garnish.

3. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   * Once the fennel is tender, add the heavy cream to the pan.
   * Let the mixture simmer gently, allowing the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly.

4. **Cook the Pasta:**
   * Meanwhile, bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
   * Cook the tagliatelle pasta according to package instructions until al dente.
   * Drain the pasta, reserving a cup of pasta water.

5. **Finish the Dish:**
   * Return the partially cooked scampi to the pan with the fennel-cream sauce.
   * Allow the scampi to finish cooking in the sauce.
   * Add a squeeze of lemon juice, and season with pepper, salt, and chili flakes to taste.
   * Toss in the cooked tagliatelle pasta, adding a bit of the reserved pasta water if needed to reach the desired sauce consistency.

6. **Serve:**
   * Garnish with finely chopped fennel fronds.
   * Serve immediately, enjoying the blend of flavors and textures.
