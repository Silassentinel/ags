# Pasta with Spicy Chorizo Scampi

## Ingredients:
- Pasta
- Chorizo
- Scampi (shrimp)
- Olive oil
- Shallots
- Yellow onion
- Garlic
- Cherry tomatoes
- Fresh tomatoes
- Curry powder (2 teaspoons)
- Paprika powder (1 tablespoon)
- Umami seasoning (1 teaspoon)
- Cardamom (1/2 teaspoon)
- Chives (2 teaspoons)
- Salt and pepper
- Red bell peppers
- Yoghurt or cream (2 tablespoons)

## Instructions:
1. Remove the casing from the chorizo and cut it into small cubes. Heat a pan over low heat and let the chorizo cubes warm up with a splash of olive oil until the fat melts.
2. Once the chorizo is cooked, remove it from the pan.
3. Finely chop shallots and yellow onion. In the same pan with chorizo fat, saut√© the chopped onions until they are well cooked. Add garlic once the onions are soft.
4. Add whole cherry tomatoes and small pieces of fresh tomatoes (2 large tomatoes) to the pan.
5. Mix in curry powder (2 teaspoons), paprika powder (1 tablespoon), umami seasoning (1 teaspoon), cardamom (1/2 teaspoon), chopped chives (2 teaspoons), salt, and pepper.
6. Add a bag of scampi (shrimp) to the pan.
7. Meanwhile, cut 2 large red bell peppers into small, equal cubes (brunoise).
8. Once the scampi turn a light pink color, remove them from the pan.
9. Add the diced red bell peppers to the pan. Let the mixture simmer without the lid to thicken the sauce.
10. Once the bell peppers have softened, reduce the heat to low.
11. Place the scampi on top of the mixture.
12. When the scampi turn a deep pink color, add 2 tablespoons of yoghurt or cream to the pan. Stir well to combine with the chorizo.
13. Decorate and season with chopped chives.

Serve the flavorful spicy chorizo scampi sauce over pasta for a delicious meal!
