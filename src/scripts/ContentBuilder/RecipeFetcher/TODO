This module fetches the recipes from the recipe repo on github : https://github.com/Silassentinel/recipes

example of a raw url : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Silassentinel/Recipes/refs/heads/main/Autumn-salad.md

first it should fetch all files at the base/root of the repo

Then get all the raw content 

and create per file a recipe page ags/src/pages/posts/Autumn-salad.md

This should be added in the buildscript at : ags/scripts/preserve-build.js
